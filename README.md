# Stripe
Chinese merchants are banned by stripe

 ###  Stripe申诉
We are a merchant from China. After we used Stripe Hong Kong for a week, Stripe told us that it would not be able to accept our website, predicting that our business will have a high risk in the future. In fact, we are a business with brand registration, in Amazon Both are sold with wish. During my use, if there is a chargeback order in your order, Stripe will immediately disable your account and inform you that the service cannot be used
Now I tell some rules for using stripe. You cannot have failed orders in your order. If there are, they will disable your account. If you contact them by email, they will keep telling you that your business is risky and eventually they All the money will be returned to the customer, but we have already shipped it.
We are a business group. I hope Stripe can give us an explanation. This is not one person, but many people.

stripe often disables customer accounts, now let me uncover this secret，A new account, when you encounter a bank refusal to pay, Stripe will disable your receiving account, then return the money to the customer, and then lose the money. If you think I did something wrong, please contact me kuajingqt@gmail.com


We are sellers from China. We use stripe companies in Hong Kong, Japan, the United States, and the United Kingdom to register stripe accounts. We sell products in Amazon. We sell products in Shopify. We open stripe. When we receive the first payment, stripe often Will disable our account and tell us that our business involves high-risk businesses, but the products we sell are not prohibited from business with stripe. When we send an email to support@stripe.com, they will usually tell you because of internal details. Can’t disclose, Stripe still cannot accept our business.
In another situation, Stripe told me that my payment would be detained for 120 days, but at the end of the day, we have already shipped the goods, and Stripe will refund the payment to the customer.
In the third case, when your new account receives a failed order or the bank refuses to pay the order, they will disable your account and return you to the customer. This is the customer's mistaken operation, but stripe disabled the merchant's account.
