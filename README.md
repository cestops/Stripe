# Stripe
Chinese merchants are banned by stripe

 ###  Stripe申诉
We are a merchant from China. After we used Stripe Hong Kong for a week, Stripe told us that it would not be able to accept our website, predicting that our business will have a high risk in the future. In fact, we are a business with brand registration, in Amazon Both are sold with wish. During my use, if there is a chargeback order in your order, Stripe will immediately disable your account and inform you that the service cannot be used
Now I tell some rules for using stripe. You cannot have failed orders in your order. If there are, they will disable your account. If you contact them by email, they will keep telling you that your business is risky and eventually they All the money will be returned to the customer, but we have already shipped it.
We are a business group. I hope Stripe can give us an explanation. This is not one person, but many people.
